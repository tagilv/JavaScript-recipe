# Recipe finder project

<h2>Recipe finder application built with JavaScript</h2>

<h2>Purpose of the application</h2>
<p>
This application was built on an api from spoonacular (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) that provides an api for recipes. I built the application on an endpoint that lets you find recipes by ingredients. Thru my application you can listen to search for recipes by ingredient (thru search) and filter based on number of likes that the recipe has as well as number of ingredients needed. I will be deploying the app in the next couple of days.
