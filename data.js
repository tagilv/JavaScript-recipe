      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).</li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.</li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>",

Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples).",

      instructions:
        "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick saute pan over medium heat. Add in the chopped shallot, garlic and bacon, cooking until the shallot softens and then bacon begins to crisp up nicely.\nToss in the mushrooms (make sure you've sliced any large ones), sauteing everything together for another 5-6 minutes, or until the mushrooms reach your desired consistency (tender, but not falling apart).\nMeanwhile, cook the pasta until it is al dente. I prefer to use a nice whole wheat fettuccine for this recipe as it pairs well with the nuttiness of the mushrooms. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside.\nAdd the peas and parsley to the skillet, season with salt and pepper and cook for just a minute or two before tossing in the pasta and mixing well, coating the pasta with the oils and fat.\nRemove the skillet from the heat and put the pasta into a large serving bowl. Shave a generous amount of Parmeggiano Reggiano over the dish, tossing to combine.\nServe with additional cheese and salt and fresh pepper, to your liking.",

      instructions:
        "Oven at 385 degrees.\nMake the pesto: In a small food processor add the garlic and almonds. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the cilantro leaves and about 3-4 Tbsp olive oil, the amount is really a preference of how loose or thick you like the pesto. Start with a little and add a little at a time until you reach the consistency of your preference. Stir in the juice of 1/2 a lime. If you are making this ahead of time...place in a bowl and drizzle just enough olive oil on top to coat, this keeps the air from getting to the cilantro. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\nSaut the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over medium high heat for just a couple minutes. Mix the peppers, corn and black beans in a bowl.\nLay out the egg roll wrappers. Smear some of the cilantro lime pesto on the end closest to you, leaving about an inch of the wrapper on the very end.\nAdd a spoon full of the veggies along the line of pesto. Brush the ends of the wrapper with water, this will help seal the egg roll. Fold the end nearest you over the veggies and the two\nsides fold in as well.\nRoll up the wrapper to the end. Place seam side down on a lined baking sheet that his been brushed with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.\nBrush the egg rolls lightly with olive oil as well, this will help get that golden color. Bake for approx 18 minutes, or until golden and crispy.",

      instructions:
        "Peel potatoes and put them in a large pot filled with water. Boil them until they're tender. Mash them and let them cool for a while.\nChop the mushrooms, carrot and red bell pepper. Add them into your food processor and pulse until all ingredients are well mixed together.\nHeat oil in a large skillet. Add the mixture above, diced onions, chopped dill and parsley, soy granules, eggs (or egg substitute) and spices. Saut for 10 minutes.\n* I added the soy granules without boiling them because the mushrooms contain a lot of water and these soy granules will absorb all excess water.\nPut some parchment paper on the bottom of a casserole. Divide the mashed potatoes in two. Place the first half in the casserole and spread it with a spatula. Add the filling. Place over the other half of mashed potatoes.\nHeat your oven at 392. Put the casserole in the oven. Cook for 40 minutes.\nDon't serve immediately. Let it cool for at least half an hour.",

        "Lightly greased a baking sheet; set aside.  In a small saucepan, bring the water just to a simmer; remove from heat.  Stir in potato flakes until moistened.  Stir in butter until it's incorporated to potato flakes.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, 3/4 cup of the cheese, baking powder, salt, and poppy seeds; stir in potato mixture and milk.  With floured hand, gently knead and fold the dough for five to six strokes, or until the dough comes together in one mass.  Pat the dough lightly to flatten it into a 9-inch circle on prepared baking sheet.  Cut dough into eight wedges using a pizza cutter or floured knife (do not separate).  Sprinkle edges with remaining cheese.\nBake in a preheated 400 degree F oven for about 25 minutes or until lightly browned.  Gently pull or cut scones to separate.  Serve warm.",

Near the end of the freezing time, you may want to shape it into balls with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.*When the mixture is frozen, it is ready to eat. You may want to let it thaw for a few minutes before serving, depending on how cold your freezer is and how solid the sorbet is.*Note: I let the sorbet freeze overnight and then let it thaw for a few minutes until I could scoop it out of the container to serve.",

        "Soak the dried fenugreek leaves in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain, making sure to squeeze out excess liquid.Sift the flours and baking soda in a small strainer into a medium bowl. Stir in the salt, chili powder, cayenne, cumin, coriander, ajwain seeds, asafetida, yogurt and fenugreek leaves. Mix in about 1/4 cup of water to make a semi-hard batter. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Dusting your hands with flour, divide the dough into 10 to 12 small balls. Roll out each ball into a roughly 3-inch circle. Brush a non-stick pan with a bit of ghee or oil and heat over medium heat. When hot, add a rolled out portion to the pan and cook for 4 minutes or until the bottom is browned. Sprinkle with a bit of oil, flip and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes or until both sides are browned. Transfer to a plate, keep heated in a 150 oven, and repeat for the rest of the pancakes.",

      instructions:
        "Hard boil your eggs.  To get perfectly hard boiled eggs, once the water is boiling, add your eggs and set your timer for 9 1/2 minutes.  As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\nNow you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil. Cut the eggs in half or quarters and serve while hot.",

        "Directions: Cut watermelon in half and remove watermelon from rind.  You can either spoon it out like a mad man, carefully remove it and cut it into squares, or scoop it all out with a melon baller-which is what I did.  I liked the look of all those succelent balls of watermelon.\nSo, scoop out your watermelon and put it in a bowl-I used the leftover water melon rind for my bowl, and youre going to add your dressing, which is so simple, soooo easy.\nMake the Salad Dressing:  Add your oil, and vinegar.  No salt necessary as the feta is salty.\nMix this all together and chill for 15 minutes, which will give you time to prep your mint.\nChiffanade the mint, which means cut it into fine ribbons. Roll up the mint leaves like a cigar and then cut it into nice strips or ribbons. I had my daughter and her friend do this for me; they are 10 so you can see how easy this is.\nNext crumble over with that delicious creamy feta cheese. The salty contrast with the sweet melon is so crazy good that it is hard to describe.\nTo finish add the fresh mint, which brings it all together. And a little more black pepper at the end so theres a little on the feta.",

        "Pour the coconut milk into a small bowl and the juice of 1 lemon, set aside for a few minutes to form a citric reaction mimicking buttermilk.\nIn a large bowl sift all the flours, baking soda, baking powder, kosher salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then add the chocolate chips.\nMeasure the oil, then add pear sauce to the oil.\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients in the large bowl, with a rubber spatula, mix until just combined.\nSet aside for 10 minutes to let all the ingredients blend.\nWhen ready, heat a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat and grease with Earth Balance spread, just enough to form a nice coat in the skillet.  Keep the spread on the side, you will need to grease more as you go along.\nWith a baking measuring cup in 1/4 cup size, scoop up batter and drop into the hot pan.  When you see little bubbles forming it is time to flip the pancakes (1-2 minutes), cook another minute until done.  Serve hot or warm.",

        "<ol><li>Preheat an oven to 350</li><li>Stud the rinsed and peeled rack of corned beef ribs with the three cloves, fairly evenly spaced along the top meaty side of the ribs.</li><li>Place the ribs in a large, deep covered roasting pan or Dutch oven.</li><li>Sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the ribs along with the slices of garlic and the bay leaves.</li><li>Add enough water to just cover the ribs - this will vary depending on the size of your pan.</li><li>Put the pan, covered, into the oven and cook for one hour.</li><li>While the ribs are braising for the first hour, prepare the vegetables.</li><li>After the first hour, add all the vegetables, except for the cabbage, into the pan. Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.</li><li>After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.</li><li>During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze.</li><li>Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.</li><li>Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li><li>Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.</li><li>Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising.</li><li>Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours).</li><li>Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs.</li><li>Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze.</li><li>Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425</li><li>Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.</li><li>When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!).</li><li>Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "To prepare the skewers:\nSoak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.",

Roll up each breast an secure with a toothpick.\nDredge in flour. Then brush with beaten eggs. Then finally roll in bread crumbs mixture.\nBrush the baking pan with olive oil, then place the chicken rolls.\nBake for about 20 minutes. Then layer each rolls with butter cubes. Let the butter melts on its top, the roll will absorb its flavor and will give a really nice smell.\nBake for another 15 minutes.\nYou may serve this your favorite sauce.",

Cook for 2 minutes or until browned on the bottom, then flip and cook for 1 more minute or until both sides are browned and the pancake is cooked throughout. Remove and continue cooking until the batter is used up.To make the sauce, combine 1 cup of the toasted coconut with the coconut milk and coconut sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Directions:</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 by 9 or 7 by 11 baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li><li>Combine the flax, applesauce and almond milk together in a small bowl. Set aside to allow to thicken. In a food processor, combine the blueberries, pear, black beans and oil. Pulse until the mixture become very smooth. Next, add the extracts and process until fully combined. Remove the contents from processor into a medium sized mixing bowl. Add the coconut sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt and mix. Add the flour with the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into your prepared dish and bake at 350 for 44-45 minutes.</li><li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 50 minutes. If you would like, place the brownies in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes to speed up cooling time. While the brownies cool, start on your mint filling.</li><li>In a small bowl, combine the soft avocado with full fat coconut milk or heavy cream. Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Add the powdered xylitol and mix well. Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread. Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.</li><li>Next, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.</li><li>Cut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li><li>NOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.</li><li>*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.</li><li>**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.</li></ol>",

        "<ol><li>Prepare the graham crust: Preheat the oven to 350.</li><li>Put the graham crackers into a food processor and pulse until the crackers break down to the consistency of sand. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the salt and melted butter and mix until the butter has thoroughly incorporated; it should be the consistency of wet sand.</li><li>Press and pack the wet graham mixture into six buttered 4 -inch tart pans, making sure it goes up all the way on the sides and that the crust is thick and sturdy.</li><li>Arrange the tarts on 1 or 2 cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes, or until the crusts are golden, but not browned. Remove the tart shells from the oven and set aside to cool.</li><li>If you are not using spring form pans, carefully remove the crusts from the pans at this stage and follow the recipe as follows.</li><li>The tart crusts can be stored in airtight plastic containers, in a single layer, for up to 24 hours.</li><li>Prepare the lime curd: Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.</li><li>Fill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. When all of the butter is melted and incorporated, stir in the lime zest and remove the saucepan from the heat.</li><li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li><li>Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth. You can also use an immersion/hand blender instead, if you have one.</li><li>The mixture can be made, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 week.</li><li>Divide the mixture among the tart shells, leaving about half of space on the top for the chocolate ganache layer. Chill in the refrigerator while making the chocolate ganache, or until set.</li><li>Prepare the chocolate ganache: Over a double boiler (simmer water over low heat in a saucepan and put a heat-resistant bowl on top), melt the chocolate together with the sugar and butter. Stir constantly until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is smooth and shiny.</li><li>Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li><li>Carefully, pour the liquid chocolate ganache over each tartlet, making sure that the chocolate does not over-flow the graham crust sides. Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)</li><li>Prepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.</li><li>Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner. Pipe the meringue on as desired.</li><li>Using a brulee torch, quickly brown the meringue, being careful not to melt the chocolate ganache on top. (Due to the chocolate ganache layer, the meringues should not be browned under a broiler.)</li></ol>",

Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)Prepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.",

        "<ol><li>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix together crushed Oreos and melted butter. Line a standard sized muffin tin with paper liners. Add a heaping tablespoon of the cookie crumb mixture to each liner, press with the back of a spoon to form the crust. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool while preparing the filling.</li><li>2. In a small bowl stir together sugar, cocoa powder and salt. In a large mixing bowl add soften cream cheese and sugar/cocoa mix. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth, add melted chocolate, heavy cream and sour cream, beat until combined. Add eggs, one at a time and mix well after each, then add in vanilla. Tap the bowl on the counter firmly a couple of times to release any air bubbles.</li><li>3. Divide batter between the cupcake liners (liners will be full). Tap the pan a couple of times to be sure there are no large air bubble. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the centers jiggle just slightly. (Original recipe called for baking time of 17-20 minutes, mine were done at the 15 minute mark.) Remove pan from oven, let cool at room temp. for 1 hour. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until fully cooled before topping.</li><li>4. Top the cheesecakes: In a medium bowl whisk together heavy cream, powdered sugar and vanilla. Place the bowl in the refrigerator, along with the beaters from your mixer, for 10-15 minutes to get everything well chilled. Add gelatin to a small bowl, add water. When gelatin absorbs all the water microwave for about 10 seconds to heat and melt the gelatin and make it pourable. Set aside to cool a bit. Beat the cream until just before it reaches soft peak stage, check your gelatin to be sure it has cooled slightly but is still a pourable consistency (if it solidified, just pop it back in the microwave for a couple seconds). With the mixer running, slowly pour in the gelatin and finish whipping the cream to soft peak stage.</li><li>5. Top the cakes with a generous spoon full of the whipped cream, using the back of a spoon make a little nest indentation in the top for the cherry filling. Add a spoon full of the cherry filling and you're done.</li></ol>",

        "<ol><li>Place cod in a bowl and cover with cold water. Soak for 6 to 8 hours, changing the water once or twice. Drain, rinse very well and pat dry. Shred fish with your fingers.</li><li>Pour 3 inches of water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the diced potatoes, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes, return them to the pan briefly. (The heat from the pan will evaporate excess moisture from the potatoes.) Mash the potatoes until smooth, then whisk in the butter.</li><li>Stir the cod into the mashed potatoes. Stir in the green onion, cilantro, olives, egg white, sesame oil, salt, garlic, ginger and pepper.</li><li>In a chilled bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into cod mixture with a rubber spatula.</li><li>Using two large soupspoons, form about 3 tablespoons of the cod-potato mixture into an oval fish cake. Set the cod cake on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining potato mixture.</li><li>Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. Beat the egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Dip each cod cake into egg, turning it gently to coat all sides. Allow any excess egg to drip back into the bowl, then roll the cake in breadcrumbs to coat all sides. Set the coated fish cakes on a baking sheet.</li><li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot - a corner of a cod cake will give off a lively sizzle when dipped in the oil - add as many of the fish cakes to the skillet as will fit without touching each other. (You may need to do this in two batches.) Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li><li>Remove the fish cakes with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels. If necessary, repeat with the remaining cod cakes. Serve warm.</li><li>This recipe yields 4 servings.</li></ol>",

        "Begin by cutting the mangoes into small 1.5cm by 1.5cm cubes.\nPlace the mangoes in a large mixing bowl. Grate the zest of 1 lime into the mangoes.\nSqueeze juice from half a lime into the mangoes. Add more lime juice to taste if required later.\nChop a bunch of coriander leaves (or use mint leaves if you hate the taste of coriander) into fine bits.\nAdd the chopped coriander to the mango mixture.\nStir well to combine. In fact, Suvarna recommended to stir well after the addition of every ingredient.\nCut the shallots or red onion into very thin slices.\nAdd the sliced shallots or red onion to the mango mixture and stir well to combine.\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt or to taste.\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper or to taste.\nAdd 1 teaspoon of sugar or to taste.\nStir well to combine and do a taste test. Add lime juice, sugar, salt or pepper as necessary to get a nice savoury sweet tangy flavour.\nFinally add the chopped chillis. Add according to your own heat tolerance. Some chillis are more spicy than others so add a little at a time till you acquire the desired spiciness. Stir well to combine.\nCover the bowl with cling wrap and place bowl in the fridge for at least 1/2 hour for the flavours to combine.\nKeep the mango salsa chilled till ready to serve.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Mix the mayo, lime juice and chopped jalapeno in a small bowl. Salt and pepper to taste, then put in the fridge.</li><li>Chop all veggies and set aside.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a small pan over medium-high heat. Add the green onions and allow them to saute for 1-2 minutes. Pour both cans of drained beans into the pan. Bring to a simmer and add the cumin, cayenne and  tsp. of salt. Squeeze a couple of lime wedges into the beans. Cook for 5 minutes longer. Cover and set aside. Top the beans with cheese when you are ready to serve them.</li><li>Heat a large skillet to high heat. Cut the fish into 1 x 3 inch strips. Drizzle oil on the fish, then salt and pepper both sides.</li><li>Pour the cornmeal into a pie pan. Roll the fish strips in cornmeal, shaking off the excess.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan. When it is hot, cook half the fish strips 1-2 minutes per side, until opaque and flaky. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish. Remove the fish from the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat.</li><li>Warm the tortillas in the microwave. Divide the fish between 8 tortillas. (You can double up the tortillas so they wont break!) Then top each with cabbage, tomatoes, cilantro and jalapeno-lime sauce. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce, black beans on the side.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        'Chill 1 1/2 cups whipping cream in refrigerator. Chill metal mixing bowl and mixer beaters in freezer.\nIn top of a double boiler, combine chocolate chips, coffee, rum and butter. Melt over barely simmering water, stirring constantly. Remove from heat while a couple of chunks are still visible. Cool, stirring occasionally to just above body temperature.\nPour remaining 1/4 cup whipping cream into a metal measuring cup and sprinkle in the gelatin. Allow gelatin to "bloom" for 10 minutes. Then carefully heat by swirling the measuring cup over a low gas flame or candle. Do not boil or gelatin will be damaged. Stir mixture into the cooled chocolate and set aside.\nIn the chilled mixing bowl, beat cream to medium peaks. Stir 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whipped cream in two doses. There may be streaks of whipped cream in the chocolate and that is fine. Do not over work the mousse.\nSpoon into bowls, chocolate cups (see note in About section) or martini glasses and chill for at least 1 hour. Garnish with fruit and serve.\n(If mousse is to be refrigerated overnight, chill for one hour and then cover each with plastic wrap)',

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>",

I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!",

        "<ol><li>Make Lemon Dill Hollandaise:</li><li>Fill a medium saucepan about halfway with water, and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Put the egg yolks and water in a heatproof bowl, season with a pinch of dill (if using dried), salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together and then place the bowl on top of the saucepan. Keep stirring the egg mixture for about 5 minutes or until it begins to thicken. Make sure you dont scramble your eggs! Once the eggs are thickened, take the bowl off the water and set aside.</li><li>Poach the eggs:</li><li>Fill a medium saucepan with water, add a splash of white vinegar (optional, but this helps hold the whites together which results in nicely shaped eggs) and bring to a gentle simmer. You want tiny bubbles only, not a rolling boil. Gently add eggs to water and poach until deisred doneness.</li><li>Meanwhile, toast bread.</li><li>Place toast on plates and top with arugula, spinach and salmon. Place eggs on top of salmon and spoon hollandaise over the top. Garnish with dill, salt and freshly cracked black pepper and serve.</li></ol>",

Once the eggs are thickened, take the bowl off the water and set aside.Poach the eggs:Fill a medium saucepan with water, add a splash of white vinegar (optional, but this helps hold the whites together which results in nicely shaped eggs) and bring to a gentle simmer. You want tiny bubbles only, not a rolling boil. Gently add eggs to water and poach until deisred doneness.Meanwhile, toast bread.",

        "Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Stir in the pasta and cook until tender according to the package instructions  about 10 minutes depending on the type of pasta used. Stir often. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and rinse the pasta in cold water. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium or large saucepan. When hot, add the onion to the pot and saut for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the carrot and saut for another few minutes. Now add the garlic and chilies, and continue to saut for another minute.Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric and amchoor powder if using, stir for another minute, and then add the tomato. Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese.",

Place remaining phyllo on top of last walnut layer; brush with butter.\nWith sharp knife, cut just halfway through layers in triangle or diamond pattern.\nBake in 300 degree oven for 1 hour and 25 minutes or until top is golden brown.\nIn small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat honey until hot but not boiling. Evenly spoon hot honey over hot baklava.\nCool Baklava in dish on wire rack at least 1 hour; cover with foil and let stand at room temperature until serving.\nTo serve, finish cutting, with a sharp knife, through layers to make triangles or diamonds.',

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Measure flour mix, using a large spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup, then level it off with the back of a knife. Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.  Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.</li><li>Add dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.</li><li>Using a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.</li><li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>",
